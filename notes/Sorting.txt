##  Array SORTING Algorithms ##

1. BUBBLE SORT
~~ iterative ~~
-compare adjacent elements
-swap if out of order
-move to next pair
-repeat for all elements

each iterations sorts one elemts from the end of array
outer loop: i=0 -> n-1
inner loop: j =1 -> n-1-i
T -> O(n2)
S -> O(1)


2. INSERTION SORT
~~ recursive technique ~~
array is considered as two parts - sorted & unsorted
idea is to take the top(first) element of the unsorted array and INSERT it at the correct location in the sorted array by shifting existing elements
each iteration reduces unsorted and increases sorted eventually whole array sorted

partition function --(main logic of inserting at correct position)


T -> O(nlog n)
S ->


3. SELECTION SORT
~~ recursive ~~
array - sorted & unsorted
here we SELECT the minimum from the unsorted part and put it in sorted array
idea of 

T ->
S ->


4. QUICK SORT




5. MERGE SORT

T ->
S ->
