##  Array SORTING Algorithms ##

1. BUBBLE SORT

~~ iterative ~~
-compare adjacent elements
-swap if out of order
-move to next pair
-repeat for all elements

each iterations sorts one elemts from the end of array
outer loop: i=0 -> n-1
inner loop: j =0 -> n-1-i
T -> O(n2)
S -> O(1)


2. INSERTION SORT

~~ iterative technique ~~
array is considered as two parts - sorted & unsorted
idea is to take the top(first) element of the unsorted array and INSERT it at the correct location in the sorted array by shifting existing elements
each iteration reduces unsorted and increases sorted eventually whole array sorted

outer loop: i=1 -> n (end of arr)
inner loop: j=i-1 -> 0  (ulta chalenge)
current element being compared -> temp

T -> O(n2)
S ->


3. SELECTION SORT

~~ iterative ~~
array sorted & unsorted
here we SELECT the minimum from the unsorted part and start putting in array in sequential order 
(by swapping the current pos with the min pos in each iteration)

keep track of positions 

outer loop: i = 0 -> n-1
inner loop: j = i+1 -> n

T ->
S ->


4. QUICK SORT


partition function --(main logic of inserting at correct position)


5. MERGE SORT

T ->
S ->
